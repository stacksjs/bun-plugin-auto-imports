This Bun plugin allows for support of auto-imports in your server-side code.

## Features

- Auto-imports support for Bun

## Usage

```bash
bun install -d bun-plugin-auto-imports
```

You may now use the plugin:

```ts
// index.ts
import type { AutoImportsOptions } from 'bun-plugin-auto-imports'
import { plugin } from 'bun'
import { autoImports } from 'bun-plugin-auto-imports'

const options: AutoImportsOptions = {
  presets: ['solid-js'], // any unimport presets are valid
  imports: [{ name: 'z', from: 'zod' }],
  dirs: ['./src'],
  dts: `./src/auto-import.d.ts`, // default is `./auto-import.d.ts`
}

plugin(autoImports(options))

Bun.serve({
  fetch: handler,
  port: 3000,
})
```

In your "server file," you may now use the auto-imported modules:

```ts
// server.ts
// `z` is auto imported from zod
const Body = z.object({
  msg: z.string(),
})

export async function handler(req: Request) {
  try {
    const body = await req.json()
    const data = Body.parse(body)

    return new Response(`Received: ${data.msg}`)
  }
  catch (e) {
    return new Response('Invalid body', { status: 400 })
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you are familiar with `unimport`, `AutoImportsOptions` proxies `UnimportOptions`.

## Testing
